# Fibonacci_TBench
This is a test bench for comparing computing times with a program that prints Fibonacci integers, from the Fibonacci series.
I am going to keep on uploading the code in diferrent languages, so the comparison can be made. I am a Linux user so my explanations are thought for linux systems. No hate for others, if you want a MS/DOS or IOS explanation you can upload them, please.
# Executing the code:
In C:
Use the Gnu C Compiler for compiling it first.
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>$ gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci_x</td>
    </tr>
</table>
Then you execute the program.
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>$ ./fibonacci_x</td>
    </tr>
</table>
And that's all for now. I'm sorry for the bad writing, I'm new at Git.

-SANG.
